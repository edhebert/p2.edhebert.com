Users to your microblog can...

1. Sign up
2. Log in
3. Log out
4. Add posts
5. See a list of all other users
6. Follow and unfollow other users
7. View a stream of posts from the users they follow
8. +1 other feature of your choosing
9. +1 other feature of your choosing

On your main landing page, clearly state what your two +1 features are.
In addition to these set requirements, you're responsible for covering all the logistical pieces of this application.

For example, you'll need to make sure non-logged in users can't see user-only areas, you'll need a navigation menu, you'll need a landing page, etc.
